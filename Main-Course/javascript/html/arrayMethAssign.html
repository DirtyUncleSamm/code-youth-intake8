    Q1 Define a function called cleanNames that accepts an array of strings containing additional space characters at the beginning and end. The cleanNames() function should use the array map method to return a new array full of trimmed names. For example:
    cleanNames([" avengers", "   captain_america", "ironman   ", " black panther   "]) 
    should give
    ["avengers", "captain_america", "ironman", "black panther"]
