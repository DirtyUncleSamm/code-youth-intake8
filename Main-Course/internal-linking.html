    <p>In Gillingham F.C.'s 1963–64 season, their 32nd in the Football League, they competed in the Fourth Division. Gillingham were undefeated in their first 13 games, the longest such run by any team in the Football League, and by the end of September were top of the league table, where they remained for much of the season. In April, the postponement of several games allowed other teams to overtake them but they moved back into the promotion places as they played the rescheduled games. They won the championship on goal average in their final game. They were eliminated in the first round of the FA Cup but reached the fourth round of the League Cup. The team played 52 matches, winning 26, drawing 15 and losing 11. Brian Gibbs was their top goalscorer with 18 goals in all competitions. Mike Burgess and John Simpson both played in every game. The highest attendance recorded that season at the club's home ground, Priestfield Stadium (pictured), was 17,421 for a game against Carlisle on 9 October</p>
